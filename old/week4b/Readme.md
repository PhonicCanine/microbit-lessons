# Week 4 - 2D Arrays (And Tic Tac Toe)

## Last week

If you haven't finished the work from last week, we'll talk about that, but if you have, we're going to work on Tic Tac Toe.

## Refresher

Arrays are the shelves we were talking about last week, and 2D Arrays are shelves within shelves. This week, we will be making a game of Tic Tac Toe work with this knowledge.

In this example, our tic tac toe board is arranged like this:

```
+---------------+
| +---+---+---+ |
| | 1 | 2 | 3 | |
| +---+---+---+ |
+---------------+
| +---+---+---+ |
| | 4 | 5 | 6 | |
| +---+---+---+ |
+---------------+
| +---+---+---+ |
| | 7 | 8 | 9 | |
| +---+---+---+ |
+---------------+
```

## Tic Tac Toe

Below is a link to the Python file we will be working on. Unfortunately, this will not run on your Microbits, so we will be doing this just on the computer today.

[tictactoe.py](Python%20Files/tictactoe.py?raw=true)

We need to write the code in the following two functions:

* getPos(y,x)
* setPos(y,x,value)

We won't be talking about how to do this specifically, but we hope you guys can figure out what to do. It's quite similar to what we did last week, except with a 2D array instead.

Please notice that any comments below the line below are not related to the task, but just explain how the rest of the game works. If you're interested, we encourage you to have a look at it, and ask questions about any part of it that doesn't make sense. But it's not something you have to do.

```py
#
#
# Only look at the code below here if you are interested!
# If you just want to get the game working, you only have to write the code above
#
